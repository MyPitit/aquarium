## My task
An aquarium owner has bought a new fish tank and wants to fill it with fish they’ll buy from a fish shop.

As the old aquarium owner phrase goes ­ t he more fish in the tank, the more monies in the bank.
The owner needs to decide if all the fish can live together harmoniously (without eating each other).

Luckily you have an [API](http://docs.fishshop.apiary.io/#reference/0/fish-compatibility) that determines if a group of fish can live together happily.
